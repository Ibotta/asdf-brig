# asdf-brig

[![GitHub Actions Status](https://github.com/ibotta/asdf-brig/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ibotta/asdf-brig/actions)

## Installation

This is a plugin for the [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) project.
To use this plugin, first [install asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf#setup).

Then, install the plugin:

```console
asdf plugin-add brig
```

## Usage

This plugin works just like all other asdf plugins. If you're unfamiliar with
asdf, take a look at [their docs](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf#usage).

TLDR;

```console
root@313545a3a332:/# asdf install brig v0.18.0
root@313545a3a332:/# asdf global brig v0.18.0
root@313545a3a332:/# brig version
v0.18.0
root@313545a3a332:/# asdf install brig v0.17.0
root@313545a3a332:/# brig version
v0.18.0
root@313545a3a332:/# ASDF_BRIG_VERSION=v0.17.0 brig version
v0.17.0
```

## Development

We provide a docker container that provides a sandbox for testing the asdf logic
without affecting your local environment.

To test the plugin inside the Docker container, execute these commands in this
repository.

```console
docker build -t asdf-test:dev .
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/root/.asdf/plugins/brig --entrypoint bash asdf-test:dev
```

Then you'll be in a docker container where you can test this logic out. Note
that we mount through the code into the `plugins` directory for testing.

```console
root@4f0d69e8bea6:/# asdf install brig v0.18.0
